# Hi!

I'm **Kaninik Baradi**. I solve [:wicked problems](), try making the world fairer, and build stuff. My work spans a range, so use these notes to dive into what you care about.

In my [:day job](#sbm-offshore-project-management), I lead engineering teams to build the [:worlds most complex FPSOs]().
Since 2025, I've also been affiliated as a researcher with TU Delft, working on institutional analysis, economics and climate justice.

### :x SBM Offshore, Project Management
As a Engineering Project Engineer, I am partly responsbile for making sure our products are built to time, cost, and quality. Since each one costs about 1.5 billion, it's quite a big deal. [Want to know more?](sbm)



## :x Project execution
I support complex delivery work: cross-discipline alignment, interface resolution, progress reporting automation, and structured risk management.

## :x Research focus
I'm exploring open-source LLM approaches for legal/policy analysis to strengthen institutional analysis outcomes.
