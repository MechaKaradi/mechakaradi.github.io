# Hi!

I'm **[:Kaninik]()**. I'm delivering multi-billion dollar engineering projects; developing tools to ensure public policy is well designed; and trying to solve other [:wicked problems]().

like creating resilient infrastructure, and achieving a fair climate transition. My work has spanned  sectors and incorporates many tools; use [these tootltips]() to deep dive on topics you're interested in. 

In my [:day job](#sbm-offshore-project-management), I lead engineering teams to build the [:worlds most complex FPSOs](). Part time, I research if climate adaptation projects are procedurally just. This includes and AI tools to I developed check if policies are designed along these principles.

### :x SBM Offshore, Project Management
As a Engineering Project Engineer, I am partly responsbile for making sure our products are built to time, cost, and quality. Since each one costs about 1.5 billion, it's quite a big deal. [Want to know more?](sbm)



## :x Project execution
I support complex delivery work: cross-discipline alignment, interface resolution, progress reporting automation, and structured risk management.

## :x Research focus
I'm exploring open-source LLM approaches for legal/policy analysis to strengthen institutional analysis outcomes.
